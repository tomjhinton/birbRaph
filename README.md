# birbRaph

- Made a little Raph in blender
- Rigged a little Raph in blender
- Wished I'd had enough time to make Dance, Dance Rapholution
- Didn't have enugh time to make Dance, Dance Rapholution
- Made little Raph dance
- Yes, I know that's not traditionally how a person can/should move
- However, Raph as we know is a mystery below the waist.


- Went through the stream and recorded some of the things Raph likes to say.
- Perlin noise is mirrored around my ego etc.
- Let ppl play them if they click the title.



- Quick shader in Raphs favourite colors
- Color palettes are like spice mixes
- Nobody would attack a spice mix because they convey so much importance and heritage for people, you'd have to be a monster to dismiss a family's garam masala or harissa for example
- Shader available in isolation [here](https://codepen.io/TomHinton/pen/bGMpXRR)
